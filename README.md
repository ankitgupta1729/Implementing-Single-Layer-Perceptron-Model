# Implementing-Single-Layer-Perceptron-Model   

Here, I Implement Single Layer Perceptron model on the following problems:   
    1. Classification of data involving linearly separable two pattern classes    
    2. Classification of data involving more than two classes where any pair of classes is linearly separable.    
    3. Downloaded appropriate data from repository UCI, and use these data for the above purpose.    
    4. Generate two well separated 2-dimensional normally distributed data to form two classes, and apply Perceptron on these data.
